# VTOLVR Polyglot

VTOLVR Localization project by the community for the community. 

This repository was created to combine all localizations that exist for VTOLVR into one central place.
This should allow for easier finding of languages, sharing them around.

**If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork this repository and create a PR with the language you'd like to contribute (or any other addition/fix).**

I am working on a mini-script that allows you to convert existing CSV files into "VTOLVR Polyglot" compatible files. (By the way, you can read more on why I use this custom system on [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md))

I am also going to be working on a web-editor that allows you to easily generate loc files without having to manually edit the text.
